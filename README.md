# 🌐 Personal Website 🌐
My first version of my personal website! https://nicholaslin718.github.io/

If you want to learn more about me, my past experiences or projects, here's a great source!

# 🐱‍💻 How I Built it

Created the website with [React](https://reactjs.org/) from scratch using [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). The website is designed with SCSS (mainly because I like the formatting of SCSS and wanted to try it out).

The website is deployed using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
